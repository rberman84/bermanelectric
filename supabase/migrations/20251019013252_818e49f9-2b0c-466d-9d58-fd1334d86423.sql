  <h2>Electrical Challenges Unique to Huntington Properties</h2>
  
  <p>Huntington''s beautiful waterfront location and historic neighborhoods present unique electrical challenges that require specialized expertise. From salt air corrosion along Huntington Harbor to aging electrical systems in 1920s colonials, local homeowners face distinct electrical issues that demand professional attention.</p>
  
  <h3>Waterfront Electrical Considerations</h3>
  
  <p>Properties near Huntington Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, and Lloyd Harbor experience accelerated corrosion of electrical components due to salt air exposure. Standard residential wiring deteriorates quickly in coastal environments, requiring marine-grade components and enhanced protection systems.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Common waterfront electrical issues include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Corroded outlets and switch plates requiring frequent replacement</li>
    <li>Rusted electrical boxes and conduit showing signs of deterioration</li>
    <li>Deteriorating insulation on exterior circuits exposing bare conductors</li>
    <li>Failed GFCI protection in wet locations creating shock hazards</li>
    <li>Dock and boat lift electrical failures from moisture intrusion</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Our waterfront electrical solutions include marine-grade components rated for coastal environments, corrosion-resistant enclosures and mounting hardware, and enhanced GFCI protection on all outdoor circuits. We provide annual inspections specifically designed for coastal properties to catch corrosion issues before they become dangerous.</p>
  
  <h3>Historic Home Electrical Upgrades</h3>
  
  <p>Many of Huntington''s beautiful Tudor and colonial homes date to the 1920s-1950s and still operate on outdated 60-100 amp electrical services. These legacy systems were designed for a simpler era with fewer electrical demands. They cannot safely support modern HVAC systems, kitchen appliances, home offices, and electric vehicle charging that today''s families require.</p>
  
  <p>Signs your historic Huntington home needs an electrical upgrade:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Frequent circuit breaker trips when running multiple appliances</li>
    <li>Dimming lights when air conditioning or other large loads start</li>
    <li>Inability to add circuits for renovations or additions</li>
    <li>Presence of outdated fuse panels instead of circuit breakers</li>
    <li>Insurance company requiring electrical system modernization</li>
  </ul>
