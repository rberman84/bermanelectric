  'Everything Huntington homeowners need to know about electrical upgrades, waterfront wiring, and local permit requirements from licensed Long Island electricians.',
  '<h2>Electrical Challenges Unique to Huntington Properties</h2>
  <p>Huntington''s beautiful waterfront location and historic neighborhoods present unique electrical challenges that require specialized expertise. From salt air corrosion along Huntington Harbor to aging electrical systems in 1920s colonials, local homeowners face distinct electrical issues.</p>
  
  <h3>Waterfront Electrical Considerations</h3>
  <p>Properties near Huntington Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, and Lloyd Harbor experience accelerated corrosion of electrical components due to salt air exposure. Standard residential wiring deteriorates quickly in coastal environments, requiring marine-grade components and enhanced protection.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Common waterfront electrical issues include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Corroded outlets and switch plates</li>
    <li>Rusted electrical boxes and conduit</li>
    <li>Deteriorating insulation on exterior circuits</li>
    <li>Failed GFCI protection in wet locations</li>
    <li>Dock and boat lift electrical failures</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Historic Home Electrical Upgrades</h3>
  <p>Many of Huntington''s beautiful Tudor and colonial homes date to the 1920s-1950s and still operate on outdated 60-100 amp electrical services. These legacy systems cannot safely support modern HVAC, kitchen appliances, home offices, and electric vehicle charging.</p>
  
  <h2>Huntington Electrical Permit Requirements</h2>
  <p>The Town of Huntington requires permits for most electrical work including panel upgrades, service changes, and major circuit additions. Berman Electric handles all permit applications, inspections, and ensures first-time code compliance.</p>
  
  <h2>Schedule Your Huntington Electrical Service</h2>
  <p>Whether you need a panel upgrade for your Cold Spring Harbor colonial or emergency service downtown, Berman Electric provides expert electrical service throughout Huntington. Call (516) 361-4068 to schedule service with our licensed electricians.</p>',

  'Everything Long Island homeowners need to know about upgrading from 100-amp to 200-amp electrical service. Costs, permits, timeline, and why it matters.',
  '<h2>Why Long Island Homes Need Panel Upgrades</h2>
  <p>Most Long Island homes built before 1980 were equipped with 100-amp or 60-amp electrical service panels. Today''s homes demand significantly more power for central air conditioning, modern appliances, home offices, and electric vehicle charging.</p>
  
  <h3>Signs Your Panel Needs Upgrading</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Frequent circuit breaker trips</li>
    <li>Dimming lights when appliances turn on</li>
    <li>Inability to add new circuits</li>
    <li>Insurance requiring modernization</li>
    <li>Presence of fuse box instead of breakers</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>100-Amp vs 200-Amp Service</h2>
  <p>A 100-amp service provides 24,000 watts while 200-amp doubles that to 48,000 watts. Modern homes with central AC, electric appliances, and EV charging need 200-amp service.</p>
  
  <h2>The Panel Upgrade Process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Professional load calculation</li>
    <li>PSEG Long Island coordination</li>
    <li>Municipal permit filing</li>
    <li>Installation (6-8 hours)</li>
    <li>Municipal inspection and approval</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Cost of Panel Upgrades</h2>
  <p>Typical Long Island panel upgrades range from $2,500-$4,500 including permits, labor, and materials.</p>

  <p>Long Island winters bring unique electrical challenges from space heater overloads to ice storm power outages. Preparing your electrical system prevents dangerous situations and costly repairs.</p>
  
  <h3>Space Heater Safety</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Never use extension cords with space heaters</li>
    <li>Plug directly into wall outlets only</li>
    <li>Keep 3 feet clearance from combustibles</li>
    <li>Never leave running unattended</li>
