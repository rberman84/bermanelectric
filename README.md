# Berman Electric Web Application

This repository hosts the marketing site for Berman Electric. The project is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file based on the provided template:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Populate the Supabase credentials before running the app locally or in CI:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

## Quality tooling

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint with strict TypeScript rules and Prettier integration. |
| `npm run format` | Format the repository with Prettier. |
| `npm run format:check` | Verify that files conform to the configured Prettier style. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run the TypeScript compiler in no-emit mode for strict type safety. |
| `npm run test` | Execute the Vitest unit test suite (headless). |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run the Vitest suite in watch mode for development. |

## Testing SEO outputs

Unit tests live in `src/components/__tests__` and focus on validating SEO metadata and schema.org structured data generated by the `<SEO />` and `<BlogSEO />` components. The tests leverage `react-helmet-async` to assert on runtime head tags and JSON-LD payloads.

## Continuous integration and preview builds

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs on pushes and pull requests. It performs the following checks:

1. Install dependencies and cache them for faster builds.
2. Lint, type-check, and execute the unit tests.
3. Produce a production build and upload it as an artifact for previewing changes without deploying to production.

Download the `vite-dist` artifact from a workflow run to preview the latest build locally using `npm run preview`.

## Deployment

To publish updates, deploy the contents of the `dist/` directory produced by `npm run build` to your hosting provider of choice.
