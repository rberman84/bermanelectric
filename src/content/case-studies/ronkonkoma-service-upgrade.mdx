When this Ronkonkoma homeowner ordered an electric vehicle, their existing 100 amp fuse panel simply could not support the load. They also wanted better protection from frequent coastal storms. We designed a service upgrade that delivered capacity, resilience, and EV readiness.

## Project goals

- Replace outdated fuse panel with modern 200A load center
- Provide dedicated capacity for a future Level 2 EV charger
- Improve storm resilience with new grounding and surge suppression
- Minimize downtime for kitchen appliances during the cutover

## What we found onsite

The original service conductors were undersized aluminum with cracked insulation. Grounding electrodes were corroded and the main bonding jumper was missing altogether. Several multi-wire branch circuits shared breakers, creating nuisance trips whenever large appliances started.

## Our approach

1. **Load study:** We calculated existing appliance demands plus the planned EV charger to confirm the 200 amp service size and feeder dimensions.
2. **Permits and scheduling:** Our office handled Suffolk County permitting and locked in a PSEG disconnect window that aligned with inspection availability.
3. **Service replacement:** New copper service entrance conductors, meter pan, weather head, and Siemens panel were installed with a Type 1 surge protective device.
4. **EV rough-in:** A 100 amp garage subpanel, EMT stub-outs, and pull strings were installed so the homeowner can add a charger in under two hours when ready.

## Results delivered

- Utility downtime kept to four hours with temporary feeds for refrigeration
- Surge protection and grounding now compliant with 2023 NEC and local ordinances
- Homeowner can add a ChargePoint or Tesla wall connector without new permits
- Insurance carrier satisfied documentation for updated electrical service

Need more capacity for your renovation or EV plans? We manage every step—from permits to final inspection—so your home is ready for the next decade of electrical demand.
