# Project Overview

Berman Electric replaced a failing 100-amp panel in Ronkonkoma with a modern 200-amp service, complete with new grounding, bonding, and whole-home surge protection.

## Challenges We Solved

- Frequent breaker trips whenever the homeowner ran the oven and dryer together.
- Flickering lights during peak load and storm events.
- No remaining breaker spaces for an EV charger or hot tub.

## What We Delivered

1. Coordinated shutdown with PSEG Long Island and secured Town of Islip permits.
2. Installed a Siemens 200-amp load center with copper bus and AFCI/GFCI protection where required.
3. Added whole-home surge protection and expanded grounding electrodes.
4. Tested every circuit and walked the homeowner through the new capacity plan.

## Next Steps for the Homeowner

The property is now ready for Level 2 EV charging, future solar interconnection, and backyard improvements without overloading the electrical system.
