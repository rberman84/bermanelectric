Keeping your family safe starts with a clear view of how electricity flows through your home. Over two decades of service calls on Long Island have shown me that most emergencies were preventable with a short annual inspection.

## 1. Schedule a yearly panel check

Your panel is the heartbeat of the home. Look for rust, buzzing, or heat on breakers. If labels are missing or outdated, have a licensed electrician map them. Federal Pacific and Zinsco panels should be replaced immediately.

- Verify main lugs are tight
- Scan for double-tapped breakers
- Confirm the grounding electrode system is intact

## 2. Test GFCI and AFCI protection

Bathrooms, kitchens, garages, and outdoor circuits need GFCI devices. Press the test button monthly and reset. If your home has older bedrooms, upgrading to AFCI breakers prevents arc faults that start fires behind walls.

## 3. Watch your load balance

Extension cords and daisy-chained power strips are warning signs. Spread major appliances across dedicated circuits. If lights dim when a microwave runs, the circuit is overloaded and needs redistribution.

- Laundry rooms often exceed the 20 amp circuit design
- Window AC units deserve dedicated circuits in summer
- Space heaters and hair dryers should never share outlets

## 4. Outsource major installations

Hot tubs, EV chargers, and generators demand permits, dedicated wiring, and utility coordination. DIY shortcuts risk insurance denial and expensive damage. Hire a licensed electrician who can pull permits and warranty the work.

## 5. Prepare for coastal storms

Before hurricane season, trim branches away from service drops, inspect exterior receptacles, and confirm backup generators start within seconds. After any flood or lightning strike, schedule a full inspection to catch hidden damage.

Staying proactive beats emergency calls every time. When you need a second set of eyes on your electrical system, we bring calibrated test equipment, thermal imaging, and local code expertise right to your door.
