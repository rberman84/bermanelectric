Cutting corners on electrical work almost always costs more. When unlicensed work fails, you pay for emergency repairs, damage remediation, and new inspections.

## Where DIY electrical goes wrong

- Missing permits that delay home sales
- Incorrect wire sizing that overheats circuits
- Lack of GFCI/AFCI protection that voids insurance
- No warranty when problems surface

## Licensed electricians protect your budget

1. **Code compliance:** Work meets NEC and local requirements the first time.
2. **Warranty coverage:** Materials and labor are documented for future claims.
3. **Resale value:** Inspection reports show buyers everything was done professionally.
4. **Emergency avoidance:** Proper sizing and protection prevent catastrophic failures.

Hiring a licensed electrician pays for itself. Instead of chasing emergencies, call Berman Electric to design safe, efficient solutions that last.
