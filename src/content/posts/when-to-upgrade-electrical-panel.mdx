Modern appliances and EV chargers draw more power than the 60 or 100 amp panels installed decades ago. If your lights dim when a microwave or AC starts, the panel is due for an upgrade.

## How to spot an undersized panel

- Breakers trip often or feel warm
- Rust or corrosion shows near breakers or the neutral bar
- You rely on power strips for permanent appliances
- Rooms lose power when multiple devices run simultaneously

## Why 200 amps is the new standard

A 200 amp service comfortably supports EV chargers, heat pumps, and smart-home loads. It also gives the headroom required for future electrification incentives.

## What an upgrade includes

1. **Load analysis:** Calculate demand to size feeders and breakers.
2. **Permitting:** File paperwork with the town and coordinate with PSEG.
3. **Swap day:** Replace the meter can, service conductors, panel, and main bonding.
4. **Protection:** Install whole-home surge suppression and label every circuit.

Upgrading the panel is the safest way to prepare for EV charging and future electrical projects. When you are ready, we handle the permits, temporary power, and final inspection so the transition is smooth.
